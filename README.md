Welcome to Pygubu!
============================================

`Pygubu` is a [RAD tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development) to enable quick and easy development of user interfaces for the Python's `tkinter` module.

The user interfaces designed are saved as [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) files, and, by using the _pygubu builder_, these can be loaded by applications dynamically as needed.

Pygubu is inspired by [Glade](https://glade.gnome.org).

Installation
====

Pygubu requires Python >= 2.7 (Tested only in Python 2.7.3 and 3.2.3 with tk8.5).

You can install pygubu using:

### zip tarball

Download and extract the [tarball](http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/definition/tarball). Open a console in the extraction path and execute:

```
python setup.py install
```

### pip

```
pip install pygubu
```

Note that if you are using a Python 3 version, you might want to use its `pip` tool, for example:

    pip3.5 install pygubu
    
In the previous case, I am using the `pip` tool of Python 3.5.  


To check that the installation was successful, you can try to import `pygubu` (for example from the [IDLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLE_(Python)))

    import pygubu
    
If you have no `ImportError`, then your installation was successful.

Usage
=====

Type on the terminal one of the following commands depending on your system.

### Unix-like systems

```
pygubu-designer
```

### Windows

```
C:\Python34\Scripts\pygubu-designer.bat
```

Where `C:\Python34` is the path to **your** Python installation directory.


The following _pygubu-designer_ interface should appear:

[]()

Create an UI definition using **pygubu-designer** and save it to a file.

[helloworld.ui] (examples/helloworld.ui)

Then, create your aplication script as shown below:

```python
#test.py
try:
    import tkinter as tk
except:
    import Tkinter as tk
import pygubu


class Application:
    def __init__(self, master):

        #1: Create a builder
        self.builder = builder = pygubu.Builder()

        #2: Load an ui file
        builder.add_from_file('helloworld.ui')

        #3: Create the widget using a master as parent
        self.mainwindow = builder.get_object('mainwindow', master)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = Application(root)
    root.mainloop()
```
